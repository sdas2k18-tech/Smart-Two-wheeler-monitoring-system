# Smart-Two-wheeler-management-system
Build a prototype of vehicle management for monitoring vehicle dynamics using IoT consisting of 3 sub-systems skid prevention system, tyre pressure check system and anti-theft and emergency system

Tech stack- IoT, arduino, embedded, robotics.

Objectives-   Monitoring, Maintenance and Safety of vehicle and rider
  
Smart-Two-wheeler-monitoring-system:

The system is divided into 3 sub-systems: 
Skid prevention System, Tyre pressure Check System, Anti theft and Emergency System. 

**Skid Prevention system**, bike leaning angle is monitored and analysed, and rider is provided with safe leaning angles for smooth and efficient riding experience. 

**Tyre pressure check system** check the pressure of tyres and help in maintenance of tyre health. 

**Anti-theft and Emergency system** helps in security and tracking of the vehicle.

**Emergency button** is also provided in the vehicle dashboard that would help the rider in case of accident or mishap and inform the registered mobile nos.
